Bexter is a supplementary tool that mimics a session with a Speech Language Pathologist (SLP). It is designed to help non-verbal children with autism spectrum disorder learn communicate with others. Bexter increases exposure to an Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) board. It is a take home solution that teaches the use of AAC boards through modeling. Bexter reads aloud a children's story while modeling the proper use of any AAC board. It is designed to be used in a supervised environment. Each story has key learning outcomes focusing on the repetition of certain symbols. The variety of stories allows for a balance of repetition and adaptation.

This app is meant to by parents to browse a catalogue of stories. The user can favourite stories, view previously watched stories and search stories to find one that their child will enjoy. A story can be selected based on the key learning outcomes of the session. There is a play/stop toggle to start and stop stories. The app is fully functional including the ability to create an account, link an account to a robot, and logout.
